### Initial Consultation for New Clients

**Fee: $110**
($99.91 session fee + $10.09 sales tax)

During the initial consultation we will go over your health history,
discuss conditioning goals, and introduce important concepts of
breathing and neutral alignment. If you are referred from a Health
Practitioner, we will design a session with their
recommendations. This session is 1Â½ hours in length.

### Private Sessions

**Fee: $90.00**
($81.74 session fee + $8.26 sales tax)

After your initial consultation we begin working on postural alignment
and what needs to happen in your body to create neutral alignment. For
each client those needs are different. Each session is a unique blend
of Pilates and other body therapies to achieve balance. These sessions
are 1 hour in length.

All session fees include Washington state sales tax.
